# Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM) Assignment

## Role: R&D Data Scientist at Cassandra

Welcome to the take-home assignment for the R&D Data Scientist position. This exercise evaluates your ability to use marketing science techniques.

---

## Objective

Build a Pull request that incorporates' `pymc_marketing`'s [events feature](https://www.pymc-marketing.io/en/latest/notebooks/mmm/mmm_components.html) into the `PymcModel Class`. Your goal is to:

1.  install the current project
2.  Define the best model for `data/poseidon.csv` client. check `poseidon_script.py`, for an initial model guideline.
3.  Improve the model performance by adding the event's feature into the class.
4.  Check that all tests are passing, and incorporate new tests.
5.  Run the model again using the new feature and compare results.

## Evaluation Criteria

| Criterion | Weight |
|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Technical correctness** - Valid mathematical model implementation with appropriate transformations | 35% |
| **Code quality** - Clean, readable, well-documented code | 15% |
| **Reasoning & assumptions** - Clear explanation of choices and trade-offs | 20% |
| **Insights & recommendations** - Actionable findings with business value | 30% |

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Submission

Submit your project's version with your changes. The changes will be evaluated by opening a branch of our current repository and evaluate changes and passing tests. Plus a Claude's code evaluation. Additionally, present a small presentation of both models comparison (the first model vs the model with the event feature). Present the best model according to your criteria, the model's features, their impact, and the evaluation metrics.

Good luck! We look forward to reviewing your work.
